# ML-Cohort
As part of the ML Cohort, I will be exploring various Machine Learning algorithms, understanding their working principles, and implementing them using different datasets. My focus will be on both theoretical concepts and practical applications to gain hands-on experience through various cool projects.

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
